This application is for creating, working with AVL trees.

Functions:
int max(int a, int b) - A utility function to get maximum of two integers

int height(Node *N) - A utility function to get the height of the tree

Node* newNode(int key) - Helper function that allocates a new node with the given key and NULL left and right pointers.

Node *leftRotate(Node *x) - A utility function to left rotate subtree rooted with x.

Node *rightRotate(Node *y) - A utility function to right rotate subtree rooted with y.

int getBalance(Node *N) - Get Balance factor of node N.

Node* insert(Node* node, int key) - Recursive function to insert a key in the subtree rooted with node and returns the new root of the subtree.

void preOrder(Node *root) - A utility function to print preorder traversal of the tree. The function also prints height of every node.
